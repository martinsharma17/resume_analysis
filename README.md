# Smart Resume Analyzer for Job Matching

## üöÄ Project Overview

Smart Resume Analyzer is a Python-based web application that helps job seekers and recruiters by automatically analyzing resumes and matching them with job descriptions. It extracts skills from both resumes and job descriptions, calculates a match percentage, and suggests missing skills to improve job fit.

## üõ†Ô∏è How the System Works

1. **Resume Upload**: User uploads a PDF or DOCX resume.
2. **Resume Parsing**: The system extracts text and skills from the resume using NLP.
3. **Job Description Input**: User pastes a job description into the app.
4. **JD Parsing**: The system extracts required skills from the job description.
5. **Matching Engine**: Compares resume skills with JD skills using TF-IDF and cosine similarity to compute a match score.
6. **Suggestions**: Lists missing skills and suggests improvements.
7. **Results Display**: Shows match percentage, extracted skills, and missing skills in an attractive UI.
